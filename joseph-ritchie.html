                I did the landing page. I used my own mini grid, which helped to an extent. I had no trouble
                finding open source images and the video. All of the sources/licences are listed in the
                README. I also created the logo, which was very easy. It's supposed to be a lowercase "b" for "bravo", my team. It's actually just an image, but it was a vector at one point. Now that I look at it, it kind of reminds me of the Dr. Dre Beats logo. Maybe subliminal designing? I wanted to use a subtle video because it catches the eyes of the user just enough and I like timelapses. As far as fonts go, I chose Lato for pure beauty and Ubuntu to change the pace. They're both open source via Google Fonts.

                Most of the styles I did are in the master.css. I had some fun changing the colors and the
                navbar transitions. One thing that was annoying: the tiny bit of JS. Normally I'd consider myself advanced/master at JS, but I was just simply trying match the location to every link on the screen that correlated with the current location, but I didn't realize that GitHub hosting counts the root directory as its a separate directory, so I eventually figured out that the "/ETCV/" directory needed to be sliced and taa-daa, done. As I mentioned in the README, there's a minor bug with Safari, but it's not one that I can solve (that I know of). I can't find any more ways to force Safari into using more memory. One last little interesting thing: since videos can't be scaled out of proportion, I was having mismatches with the filter and the video, so I decided to use browser width (vw) to dictate the height of both the filter and video.
            </p>

                I did a tiny bit of design refactoring at the end, but aside from that, I had some very adept team mates that knew what they were doing. No one had any problems setting up/using GitHub either, which was a dream. My team mates were great!
