                I decided to do the pricing page.  I was surprised at the number of factors that went into web development.  Everybody seemed to have a different price.  Here is some of the thinking behind my numbers.  I saw hourly prices on the order of $50-$80 and contractual prices (for larger sites) on the order of $10,000 - $20,000.  I did some math, estimating that a freelance group would only work half the year, and found that for each person to make $70,000 per year, the hourly rate is $48.  The catch is that a freelancer has no benefits, so he/she has to make more in order to pay for things like insurance, dental, 401k ect.  So $65 per hour to make $100,000 a year sounds reasonable to me.  In terms of time, a team earning a discounted rate of $50 per hour should take slightly longer than 2 weeks to complete a large $20,000 project.  If feel like it would take longer than 2 weeks to do a large project, but the number seems common enough to be reasonable.

                I decided to use the sticky footer.  I was surprised how easy it was to implement, but ended up with a bug.  The scroll bar was always showing, and I did not like that the tutorial set the margin of everything to 0.  I found that I could set the top/bottom margins of the body to 0 so I didn’t have to reset everything.  To fix the scrolling bug I made the footer a slightly smaller height than the push div.  The site insisted these two must be the same size, but I have yet to encounter a problem and the bug is fixed.

                Our team decided to use GitHub to host the webpage.  This was very nice to use because we didn’t have to deal with many conflicts.
