## Progress

Prof Lyman: The home page uses an mp4 video. If you want, I can create a fallback ogg (if you're using a different browser than Chrome, especially FF).

Got the navbar. The misc.css was missing. - Joseph
Ah ok, didnt see that css. Thanks, - Arthur

## Bugs

Due to Safari's aggressive memory maintainence, (even with preserve-3d & backface-visibility) I'm unable to force sufficient hardware acceleration to allow instant redirects via navbar links (due to anchor hover effect | it's a delay of about 200ms | only Safari on a MBA 2014). It works perfectly in Chrome, FF, IE, etc. - Joseph
