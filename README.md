## Progress



## Bugs

Due to Safari's aggressive memory maintainence, (even with preserve-3d & backface-visibility) I'm unable to force sufficient hardware acceleration to allow instant redirects via navbar links (due to anchor hover effect | it's a delay of about 200ms | only Safari on a MBA 2014). It works perfectly in Chrome, FF, IE, etc.

We'll leave each other notes about our progress/bugs in this readme.


##### Unimportant notes
- When not hosted on gh-pages, need to unslice "/ETCV/" from the pathname because it compensates for GH using the root as a separate directory.
