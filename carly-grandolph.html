            <br/>
            <p>I decided to do the About Us page.  Since this is my first experience with web design or coding in general, I thought it would be best to take a page with relatively simple requirements so I could focus on implementation.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>I decided to use floating elements to build a horizontally layed out page.  Since the About Us page in our design only really needs to name all our group members and link to their respective pages, I decided the real risk was to avoid looking like a list of links.  To do this, I created floated sections within a containing element, creating a facebook-like list effect for all our memebers.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>I decided to spice up this list by asking everyone to provide a picture, some hobbies, and their favorite youtube video, and added these elements as appropriate to our individual sections.  Finally, I finished the effect by making these entire sections into links, so that users could simply click anywhere in the section elements instead if strictly on our names.  I did this by using the onscript attribute instead of an a element, since I learned it isn't valid to nest a elements.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Finally, I learned a little about CSS selectors making clicked links have a similar color to our normally shown ones.  This change was really simple once I found it, but made our menu look a little better.</p>
