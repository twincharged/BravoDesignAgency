		<h1>Arthur Plett's Page</h1>

		<p>My experience with the team was pretty good. We got organized fairly early on, as Joseph made a Github repository for us to work in. At first, it was a little bit confusing to use, as I am not used to the command system that Github uses, but I quickly learned how to use it effectively enough to be able to upload, remove, and change files. I decided to do the team projects portion of the website. </p>
		<p>First, I worked on the HTML portion of the webpage. I decided to use a simple layout with a single element for the first projects at the top, and the other four in a pseudo-grid format below. Creating the HTML document was simple enough, and I finished that quickly. However, the CSS page for the team projects page took considerably longer. Thankfully, my fellow team members had already mostly created the master CSS page, so the basic style was already uniform through all of our pages.</p> 
		<p>The basic CSS items were easy to cover, but the responsive design was particularly tricky, and I had to use quite a few different classes and <div> tags in the HTML document for the page in order format it. I was mostly successful in creating a decent responsive design for the page, until I ran into a roadblock with making the elements centered on the page in the 800px and higher resolutions. Eventually, I came across a solution on CSS-tricks that utilized fixed positioning and the transform field, which allowed me to evenly center the two main elements of my page, the single top project, and the bottom four projects.</p>
		<p>All-in-all, this experience has been interesting. I feel that it definitely requires a good amount of coordination, and I’m glad that we started the Github early so we could get everything together in time. My group members were all pretty helpful and responsible. Overall, I enjoyed working on this type of team project.</p>
