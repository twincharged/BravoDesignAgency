    <!-- This grid ^ is a very simple, responsive one. The classes you'd be farmiliar with are
         .container, .row, .col-x, .offset-x and .clearfix. It's similar to Bootstrap's except
         you don't have to specify device size for columns. This means that .col-6 will take up
         half of the .row on any device except phones, which there is a designated breakpoint for. -->
